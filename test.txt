POMS vs. PANAS
An Analysis of Two Forms for Affect Measurement
By Andrew Pope

POMS (Profile of Mood States) and PANAS (Positive and Negative Affect Schedule) are scales for measuring the affect of a subject, though both utilize very different interpretations of what affects they should be measuring and how to properly measure those affects. POMS utilizes a very comprehensive approach, and measures six different types of affect (tension-anxiety, depression-rejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment) with 65 different adjectives {Spielberger 1972}. It is formatted as a series of questions on a five point scale, with the sections labelled not at all, a little, moderately, quite a bit, and extremely {Norcross 1984}. POMS has good internal consistency, with Cronbach coefficients of greater than 0.90 for four of its scales, and greater than 0.86 for vigor-activity and confusion-bewilderment. This discrepancy in the consistency of the scales is directly tied to the number of questions that represent the scale within the questionnaire, as the vigor-activity and confusion-bewilderment scales both have only seven and eight items, respectively. It also has a decent level of temporal stability across periods ranging from 20 days (0.64 − 0.74) to nine weeks (0.43 − 0.53), which may indicate that it is a better measure of long term mood, and may be insensitive to transitory fluctuations {Spielberger 1972}. POMS is also reasonably repeatable, both due to its temporal stability, and its cross cultural stability {Norcross 1984}. However, for use in within-participant studies, it will only see acceptable variance when asking about short temporal periods, such as today or at the moment, and even then, only after a minimum of seven days has elapsed {Mcnair 1981}. This means that it isn’t appropriate to use as a repeated measure in short term studies, as there will be little perceived variation. It also is designed for clinical applications, and as such is primarily distributed in a kit, with manuals and preprinted sheets ($144 licensing fee), this means that there could possibly be a licensing issue if the sheets are printed by individual researchers (Heuchert, 2012). 

PANAS utilizes a much more streamlined approach, and only measures along two scales (positive affect and negative affect). Positive affect is a derivative of a measure of extroversion, and focuses primarily on alertness, activity, and enthusiasm. Negative affect is a derivative of a measure of anxiety and neuroticism, and focuses primarily on unpleasant engagement and subjective distress. Positive affect and negative affect are both independent measures with very low covariance (-0.12 to −0.23), which comes from the scale being designed to minimize overlap between the adjectives used to measure positive affect and negative affect. {Watson 1988}. This means that each scale is able to signify two different characteristics, based on their high and low values. A high degree of positive affect is related to high energy, high concentration, and pleasurable engagement, while a low degree of positive affect is related to sadness and lethargy. Negative affect operates on an inverted scale, with a high degree indicating anger, contempt, disgust, guilt, fear, or nervousness, while a low degree indicates calmness and serenity {Watson 1988}. Negative affect has also been tied to poor coping, self reported stress, health complaints, and frequent unpleasant events. PANAS presents these two scales through 20 different adjectives displayed on a five point scale. It has been found that both labeled and unlabeled scales produce nearly identical results, though very slightly or not at all, a little, moderately, quite a bit, and very much are used when it is labeled. This format has a very internal consistency, and has very high alpha reliabilities, with positive affect ranging from 0.86 to 0.90 and negative affect ranging from 0.84 to 0.87. The measures are also quasi-independent of time frame, though the values of the measures increase with the temporal scale of the question {Watson 1988}. This contributes to its high degree of invariability for long time frames, which allows it to serve as a measure of disposition traits for periods greater than a day. However, for small periods of time, such as today or at this moment, it is very subject to variability, allowing it to be used as a measure of mood within nonclinical settings. The scale can be repeatedly presented to a participant in very short time periods without any confounding effects, though the shortest temporal window to date has been ten minutes of separation between tests {Egloff 2003}. However, there are also some confounding effects with positive and negative affect. Positive affect follows a diurnal cycle, with it being low at night, and high during the day. Negative affect, on the other hand, isn’t affected by time, but is governed by the degree of stress the participant is under when taking the questionnaire {Watson 1988}.

I’d suggest that, for the purposes of the proposed study, it is most likely better to utilize PANAS, as it is designed for non-clinical closely repeated measures of mood, and has a very low temporal limit on how often it can be repeated. It also is much shorter, and doesn’t take nearly as long to complete as POMS does. It also has much greater temporal stability, if you’re looking for trait based measures. Overall, POMS seems to be designed to work under drastically different conditions than social psychology studies, making PANAS the more apt tool for the job.
